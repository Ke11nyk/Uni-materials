Starting Gaussian Elimination
Initial augmented matrix:
[[-4.94435335e-02 -2.26918882e+00 -4.27176717e-07]
 [ 2.64209952e+00 -1.99516519e+00  1.43154856e-06]]

Row swap: 1 <-> 2
Matrix after row swap:
[[ 2.64209952e+00 -1.99516519e+00  1.43154856e-06]
 [-4.94435335e-02 -2.26918882e+00 -4.27176717e-07]]

Eliminate variable x1 from equation 2
Matrix after elimination:
[[ 2.64209952e+00 -1.99516519e+00  1.43154856e-06]
 [ 0.00000000e+00 -2.30652580e+00 -4.00387105e-07]]
