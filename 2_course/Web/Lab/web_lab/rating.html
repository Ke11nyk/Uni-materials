                            <p>Season 1 of Breaking Bad is not everyone's favorite, and it's understandable why. Despite only being seven episodes due to a writer`s strike, the show gets off to a slow start. This season, Walt learns of his cancer and decides to enter the world of meth-making, altering the course of his and his family's lives forever. The series opens with a bang, starting with the murder and disposal of two rival drug dealers, but after that, there's a lull that goes on a bit too long.</p>

                            <p>The first half of the final, fifth season sees Walt flying high as the sole kingpin of Albuquerque with no competition. His ego takes a huge leap, and he believes nothing can stop him, but what the viewer sees is that he's become his own worst enemy. This half of the season features a new meth lab, a train robbery, a staged suicide attempt, and loads of tension. It's number five on the list because it can also be slow for some. Part one of Season 5 is just as riveting and important as every other season, but its pacing is slower because it is the calm before the storm.</p>

                            <p>Season 2 ramps the intensity as Walt and Jesse get deeper into the drug world. Walt's troubles at home continue to mount while Jesse finds love in the form of his new landlord. As the heat rises for the two, so does their tension and animosity toward each other. Jesse becomes a more well-rounded character, as does Walt. However, fans of the series are left torn by the season finale as their trajectories in opposite directions lead to hard choices to be made, and one of the worst things that Walt has ever done.</p>

                            <p>This season is one of Breaking Bad's best as every character shines more than ever and changes drastically. Whether they know the truth about Walt's life or not, they are all feeling the side effects. Walt and Jesse sink even deeper than before into the drug world, but it's changing them the deeper they go. By the season's end, no one is ever the same again as life and death become a matter of adapt or die as Walt's actions to protect himself and Jesse start a ticking clock for the end of the line.</p>

                            <p>Season 4 is arguably Breaking Bad's most explosive. Everyone is on guard, and no one is safe as Walt's two lives are closer than ever to colliding. It'll take a miracle for Walt and Jesse to get out alive or a few dirty tricks. Let`s just say there is a reason the show's creator has grown less fond of Walter White as time goes on. But in doing so, they will soon find themselves on a spiraling path to their downfall.</p>

                            <h3>Season 5 Part 2</h3>
                            <p>It's in the final episodes of the series that everything Walt has ever done comes to a head. There is nothing to stop his two lives from colliding at this point. The only thing he can do is attempt to mitigate the result. The final half of Breaking Bad`s final season sees everyone at the top of their game as truths come to light and actions reap their final consequences. The series goes out on top, as expected. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul give the performances of a lifetime to close out this pulse-pounding series in an ending that was inevitable and yet unexpected at the same time. It's the perfect ending and showcases why Breaking bad is one of the most definitive TV series of this generation and one that will withstand the test of time for many years to come.</p>
